# What is QGears? 

Q-Gears is an RPG engine for games like Squaresoft's Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy IX or Xenogears. It is designed to be cross-platfrom and run on modern operating systems such as Win32 and Linux.

## Where can I get a build of QGears?

See here for builds http://qgears.itscovarr.com here you will find nightly builds and Linux builds for every version. Since the Windows version only builds daily not every change will have a matching Windows build.

### How do I build QGears?


#### Ubuntu Linux 14.04

Ogre version must be 1.9, Qt version 4.8, Boost version must be 55, gcc version must be 4.9, QtCreator is optional - install if you want to use this as the IDE (recommended).

**Install required packages:**
```
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install git
* sudo apt-get install build-essential
* sudo apt-get install libvorbis-dev
* sudo apt-get install libalut-dev
* sudo apt-get install cmake
* sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
* sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
* sudo apt-get install qtcreator
* sudo apt-get install libogre-1.9-dev
* sudo apt-get install libois-dev
* sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev
```

**Sync down the QGears source code:**
```
mkdir qgears
cd qgears
git clone --recursive https://github.com/q-gears/q-gears.git
cd q-gears
```

**Build the code:**
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### Ubuntu Linux 12.04

If you are using an older Ubuntu version then you will have to add PPA's to get the correct gcc/boost/ogre versions, its easier just to upgrade the Ubuntu version IMO.

Anyway here is what we need for Ubuntu 12.04 (Travis-CI) **WARNING** updating the compiler and boost via the PPA's may break your system.

**Install required packages:**
```
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install build-essential
* sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y
* sudo add-apt-repository ppa:boost-latest/ppa -y
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install git
* sudo apt-get install gcc-4.9
* sudo apt-get install g++-4.9
* sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.9 20
* sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.9 20
* sudo apt-get install libvorbis-dev
* sudo apt-get install libalut-dev
* sudo apt-get install cmake
* sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
* sudo apt-get install libois-dev
* sudo apt-get install boost1.55
* sudo apt-get install mercurial
* sudo apt-get install libcppunit-dev
* sudo apt-get install doxygen
* sudo apt-get install libxt-dev
* sudo apt-get install libxaw7-dev
* sudo apt-get install libxxf86vm-dev
* sudo apt-get install libxrandr-dev
* sudo apt-get install libglu-dev
* sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev 
* sudo apt-get install checkinstall
* sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev
```

**Sync down source for Ogre 1.9:**

```
mkdir ogre
cd ogre
hg clone https://bitbucket.org/sinbad/ogre/src
```

**Build Ogre 1.9:**

```
cd src
hg update v1-9-0
mkdir ogre_build
cd ogre_build
cmake ..
make
sudo checkinstall
cd ..
cd ..
cd ..
```

**Sync down the QGears source code:**
```
mkdir qgears
cd qgears
git clone --recursive https://github.com/q-gears/q-gears.git
cd q-gears
```

**Build the code:**
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

#### Building DEB package for Linux

To do this use "cpack -C Debug" or "cpack -C Release" after running the make command.

#### Windows

**Download and install Visual Studio 2013 "community" (free/express) edition. Install all patches/Windows updates.**
```
http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/free-developer-offers-vs
```

***Download and install WIX toolkit 3.9 (to generate MSI installer)***
```
https://wix.codeplex.com/downloads/get/925661
```

**Download and install the Ogre SDK 1.9 (The VC2013 build is not offical):**
```
https://bitbucket.org/lezo/ogre_build/downloads/OgreSDK_vc12_v1-9-0.exe
```
Install/extract to "C:\OgreSDK\"

**Download and install Git for windows:**
```
http://git-scm.com/download/win
```

**Download and install cmake for windows:**
```
http://www.cmake.org/files/v3.1/cmake-3.1.0-rc2-win32-x86.exe
```

Select "Add CMake to the system PATH for all users" - this makes things easier later on.

**Download boost 55:**
```
http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.55.0/boost_1_55_0.zip/download
```
Extract to C:\boost_1_55_0. 

**WARNING**: I recommend extracting using 7zip, if not then be sure to go in to the file properties and click "unblock" otherwise you may see "access denied" errors when building as windows will mark all of the executables as unsafe since the files came from the Internet.

Now we need to compile boost.

**Build boost 55:**

Open the Visual Studio 2013 command prompt. This can be found at "Start menu -> All programs -> Visual studio 2013 -> Visual studio tools" then you'll see "Developer Command Prompt for VS2013". Which is simply a shortcut for:

%comspec% /k ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\Common7\Tools\VsDevCmd.bat""

In the command prompt cd to the boost dir by entering:

```
"C:\boost_1_55_0" 
Then run
bootstrap.bat
Finally run (this may take a while to complete, you may pass -j8 here, where 8 is the number of cpu cores/threads to use):
b2 --toolset=msvc-12.0 --build-type=complete stage 
```

**Download the zlib dll version:**
```
http://zlib.net/zlib128-dll.zip
```
Extract to the root of C drive.


**Download Qt 4.8 source code:**
```
https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/4.8/4.8.6/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.6.zip
```
Again Extract to the root of C drive.

**Build Qt:**

Open a Visual Studio 2013 command prompt:

cd to extracted source location and enter:

```
configure -platform win32-msvc2013 -no-webkit -debug-and-release -no-phonon -no-qt3support -mp -no-scripttools -nomake demos -nomake examples -no-openssl 
```

Key in "o" to use the open source license and then "y" to agree. Once this is done enter "nmake" to finish compling Qt.

Now sync down the QGears source code, first create a directory some where you want to sync the code to using Windows explorer. Then right in the newly created directory and select "GIT Bash here".

In the git bash enter:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/q-gears/q-gears.git
```

**Building the QGears code:**
First launch a "Visual studio developer command prompt" (Found under "tools" in the start menu in the Visual studio directory" (you've already done this if you've got this far).

Now cd to where you synced the qgears source code to. For me this was "cd C:\Users\paul\Desktop\qgears\src"
```
mkdir build
cd build
set QTDIR=C:/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.6
set OGRE_HOME=C:/OgreSDK/OgreSDK_vc12_v1-9-0
cmake .. -DZLIB_ROOT=C:/zlib128-dll -DBOOST_ROOT=C:/boost_1_55_0
```

(Note how we use / and not \ in paths here).

Now you can open the newly created QGears.sln in Visual Studio and build Win32/Release or Debug. If files are added/deleted/or the depends change then repeat the set and cmake commands in the Visual Studio command prompt in order to update QGears.sln.

You can also build the sln file from the command line by entering "msbuild QGears.sln /m" in the Visual Studio command prompt.

To build the installer build the "PACKAGE" project from VisualStudio, this will generate an MSI, alternatively you can run it from the Visual Studio command prompt by entering "cpack -C Debug" (replace Debug with Release if building release).

# What next?

Now that you've got everything built see the wiki for how to run QGears, coding style, how to start hacking etc.
